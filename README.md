# ESP-Dimmer 
Allows you to connect a wifi dimmer based on the ESP8266 chip via the MQTT protocol. Currently the code has only been tested on 230V 50Hz current.

You can find the assembly diagram on EasyEDA at: https://easyeda.com/Bidules079/esp-dimmer.

In my diagram I use the ESP-WROOM-02 module, I also left the GPIO2 free, to possibly place a manual button, but the code is not intended for.
